# About Me
My name is Gabriel Bezerra, and I am a 20-year-old student currently enrolled at the Universidade Cat√≥lica de Pernambuco.</br>

I have a background in Computer Science, having completed up to the 4th semester, and I am now pursuing a degree in Digital Games, where I am currently in my 2nd semester.</br>

Beyond my academic work, I enjoy exploring creative fields such as pixel art and electronic music production, which I often use in my personal and academic game projects. While I am still developing my skills in these areas, I value the opportunity they give me to blend art, sound, and technology.</br>

I plan to use this GitHub repository as a space to store and document the code I develop throughout my time at university, showcasing both my growth as a developer and my passion for game creation.</br>
